#Annotate

Annotate is work-in-progress, its a javascript module which adds annotations to an element specified when calling the function.

You can view a demo [here](http://nick.kanicweb.com/projects/annotate)

##Requirements
To run the demo as is, you need a mysql database named annotate with a table named annotations (export below)
You also need a db_connect.php file in your server's root directory.

Phpmyadmin annotations table export:

	SET SQL_MODE="NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO";

	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `annotations` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `x` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `y` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  `text` text NOT NULL,
	  `source_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=28 ;
	

Sample db_connect.php

	mysql_connect("localhost", "youruser", "yourpass") or die(mysql_error());



##Usage

Annotate requires jQuery 1.6.1

To use download the annotate.js file and reference it in the head section of your page.
You must also make a call to the annotate_js function. Which takes three parameters, described below.

The simplest possible call to annotate_js is as follows:

	annotate_js({source_element: "#source"});
	
Every other parameter is optional, however you will be missing a lot of functionality without them.

##Parameters

annotate_js has a function header as follows:

	annotate_js(settings, save_annotations_to, saved_annotations)
	
Each paramater is described below

###Settings:

A JSON Object passed in controlling the behavior of annotate. This is required.

__source_element:__
The element the annotations should be added to. This is required.

__annotation_xoff:__
The X offset in pixels to use when placing annotations -- useful if you don't want the annotation's top-left corner aligned to the mouse click

__annotation_yoff:__
The Y offset in pixels to use when placing annotations -- useful if you don't want the annotation's top-left corner aligned to the mouse click

__add_control:__
The button that will be used as the add annotation tool. When add is "on" there will be a "selected" class applied to the button.

__toggle_control:__
The button that will be used as the Toggle all control.


###save_annotations_to:

This is an object, it usually starts empty. The state of the annotations on the page are represented within save_annotations_to.json, it is updated any time the state changes.


###saved_annotations:

A JSON Object representing any annotations you would like to be automatically populated when the page loads

__x:__ The x position of the annotation relative to the source_element

__y:__ The y position of the annotation relative to the source_element

__text:__ The annotation's text
